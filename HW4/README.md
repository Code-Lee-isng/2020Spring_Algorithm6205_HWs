# using the index wisely

Problem is that how could we find all the repeated elements in such an array: all ellments are in the range of 0 to n-1.(n is length of the array.)

For T O(n^2), we could use nested loop, every loop we are going to count how many "i"s in the array.

For T O(N), S O(n), just store the repeated times in an array.

For T O(n), THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND A WAY TO STORE THE REPEATED TIMES? ADDING N TO EVERY EXISTING NUMBERS.

A new way to consider, remember.
